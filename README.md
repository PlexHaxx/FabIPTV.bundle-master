### Introduction ###
A simple [Plex Media Servers](https://www.plex.tv/downloads) plug-in for FabIPTV based on the amazing code by Cigaras https://github.com/Cigaras/IPTV.bundle

Lets you watch FabIPTV Streams (provided by yourself) on Plex 

I have Changed a few things so it works better for my environment, which may or may not be to your tastes

EPG - removed the description as it allows me to see more shows upcoming rather than whats on Now - for the most part you at least get Now and Next (formatting is not the best but ill work on it)
Defaults - Set the defaults so that its easier to set up with Fab 
Logo - Changed logo to Fab
Edited title so that it doesnt (or shouldnt) overwrite the original IPTV plugin if you run both


I have Left the Donation links at the top of this page for Valdas (Cigaras) as his code is great so please donate to show support for his great work, this donation is nothing to do with me as only minimal things have been changed for the use of Fab Users
